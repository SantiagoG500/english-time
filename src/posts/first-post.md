**"Tears in rain"** is a 42-word monologue, consisting of the last words of character **Roy Batty** (portrayed by Rutger Hauer) in the 1982 **Ridley Scott** film **Blade Runner**. Written by David Peoples and altered by Hauer, the monologue is frequently quoted. Critic Mark Rowlands described it as "perhaps the most moving death soliloquy in cinematic history", and it is commonly viewed as the defining moment of Hauer's acting career.

### Context

The monologue is near the conclusion of Blade Runner, in which detective Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) has been ordered to track down and kill Roy Batty, a rogue artificial **"replicant"**. During a rooftop chase in heavy rain, Deckard misses a jump and hangs on to the edge of a building by his fingers, about to fall to his death. Batty turns back and lectures Deckard briefly about how the tables have turned, but pulls him up to safety at the last instant. Recognizing that his limited lifespan is about to end, Batty further addresses his shocked nemesis, reflecting on his own experiences and mortality, with dramatic pauses between each statement

> I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...
> Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion...
> I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate.
> All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain... Time to die
